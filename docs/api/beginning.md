# What you must do BEFORE you begin!

## Install Node

In order to do anything, you're going to need NodeJS! This will be our entry point in using many different packages and having access to the OneBlink CLI to upload the API you are creating.

You are able to install NodeJS on the Node website featured [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## Install a Code Editor (Optional)

This step is optional, but highly recommended. Unless you want to deal with Notepad or another text editor, it is strongly recommended you install a Code Editor to write all of your code in. Writing your code in a Code Editor will save you a lot of headache and struggles by showing you different errors in your code as well as provide many helpful extensions that can automate and improve your experience.

The Code Editor that is recommended is Visual Studio Code By Microsoft, you can install it from this link [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## Install The OneBlink CLI Via NodeJS

Now, this will be your gateway to getting your API code into your account on the OneBlink Console. Firstly, open up your respective terminal depending on the device you are using.

If you are using Windows: Open up Powershell or CMD.

If you are using Mac: Open up terminal.

Once opened, type in this:

```bash
npm install @oneblink/cli -g
```

This will lead to the OneBlink CLI package being installed on your machine globally.

Now that this is all installed, you can begin writing code for your API!
