# Logging In with the OneBlink CLI

## Logging in

Before we can do anything with the OneBlink CLI, we have to log in first. So, let us get our terminal opened first!

Open up your respective terminal again depending on your OS.

If you are using VS Code, you can open the terminal pressing <code>crtl+shift+\`</code> on Windows or <code>command+shift+\`</code> on Mac.

If you are not, you can open the terminal the same way you have previously.

After you have opened the terminal, you can login by typing:

`oneblink login`

You will have your default browser open where you can login. After logging in, you will be given a code that you can copy and paste into your terminal.

After copying the code, we are now able to use the CLI functions for our API!
